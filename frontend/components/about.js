          Hey, thank you for coming to my portfolio. Let me share with you a bit about my development journey. I started my journey as a python developer. My first language was python. Later on, I learned C, html and CSS. I find myself interested in web-development. I learn React a little bit and learn about some basics of it. Later on, the NexJs frameworks helped me a lot and it easy for me to implement it and make projects in it. In the backend, I found myself comfortable in using Sanity CMS. A database does not need to be created and hosted, so this saves a lot of time.
